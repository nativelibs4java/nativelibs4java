/**
 * Track references to arbitrary objects using proxy and weak references. To
 * monitor a handle, one should call {@link #monitor(Object, ReleaseListener)},
 * with the given handle object usually being a holder that uses the target
 * object underneath, and the release listener performing cleanup of the
 * target object once the handle is not strongly referenced anymore.
 *
 * <p>When a given handle becomes weakly reachable, the specified listener
 * will be called by a background thread. This thread will only be started
 * lazily and will be stopped once no handles are registered for monitoring
 * anymore, to be restarted if further handles are added.
 *
 * <p>Thanks to Tomasz Wysocki for the suggestion and the original
 * implementation of this class!
