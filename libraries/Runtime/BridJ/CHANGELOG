Current version : BridJ 0.4-SNAPSHOT

- Added parsing of GNU LD scripts (issue #61)
- Fixed demangling of size_t / long C types with GCC
- Fixed Linux x86 symbols
- Added simple C++ virtual overrides : it is now possible to subclass C++ classes from Java, even with anonymous inner classes ! (no support for multiple inheritance yet)
- Fixed crash in C++ destructors at the JVM shutdown (issue #60)
- Fixed callbacks with float args
- Added support for varargs functions

BridJ 0.3.1 (r1817, 20110329)

- Introduced basic C++ templates support (binding of compiled template classes, not template methods / functions yet)
- Added dynamic functions support : Pointer.asDynamicFunction(callConv, returnType, argTypes...)
- Added support for arbitrary C++ constructors
- Added support for __stdcall callbacks
- Added COM VARIANT class with very basic data conversion support
- Added many COM UUID definitions (from uuids.h, codecapi.h, ksuuids.h)
- Added Solaris x86 support
- Added @DisableDirect annotation to force-disable raw assembly optimizations (also see BRIDJ_DIRECT=0 or -Dbridj.direct=false for global disable)
- Fixed long return values (issue #47)
- Fixed '@Ptr long' return values on 32 bits platforms
- Fixed structs sub-structs and array fields
- Fixed unions : 
	- pure unions can be created with the @Union annotation on the union class (+ fields annotated with @Field(value = uniqueId))
	- structs with unioned fields can be defined with fields annotated with @Field(value = uniqueId, unionWith = indexOfTheFirstFieldOfTheUnion) 
- Fixed size computation of unions & structs (issue #51)
- Fixed JAWTUtils on win32 (issue #52)
- Fixed Pointer.pointerToAddress(long, Class, Releaser) (issue #48)
- Fixed incomplete refactoring (issue #58)
- Moved all the is64Bits(), isWindows()... methods and SIZE_T_SIZE constants out of JNI class into new Platform class
- Moved the C++ symbols demanglers to package org.bridj.demangling
- Renamed Pointer.asPointerTo(Type) to Pointer.as(Type)
- Enhanced FlagSet (added toString(), toEnum(), fromValue(ValuedEnum<E>))
- Enhanced Pointer (added allocate(Type), allocateArray(Type, long))
- Greatly enhanced the API Javadoc

BridJ 0.3 (r1638, 20110204):

- Fixed binding of "c" library on Unix
- Fixed iteration on unbound native-allocated pointers (issue 37). 
- Fixed Visual C++ demangling (issue 36 : bad handling of back-references).
- Added Pointer.getBuffer(), getSizeTs(), getCLongs() and other missing methods.
- Fixed byteOffset-related issues in CLong and SizeT pointer read/write methods.
- Renamed most pointer byteOffset methods with an -AtOffset suffix (for instance, Pointer.getInt(long) becomes getIntAtOffset(long))
- Inverted charset and StringType arguments in Pointer.getString / .setString methods
- Renamed Pointer.withIO(PointerIO<U>) to Pointer.as(PointerIO<U>)
- Added Pointer.asUntyped() (equiv. to Pointer.as((Class<?>)null))
- Allow pointerToBuffer on a non-direct buffer (and added Pointer.updateBuffer
to copy data back to non-direct buffer if needed)
- Assume @Runtime(CRuntime.class) by default
- Autodetect calling convention on Windows (based on name mangling), unless convention is explicitely specified with @Convention(Style.X)
- Added BRIDJ_<LIBNAME>_LIBRARY environment variables to hard-code the shared library path in priority
- Added library alias mechanism : BridJ.setNativeLibraryActualName, .addNativeLibraryAlias
- Fixed callbacks-related Win32 crashes
- Fixed super-critical bug on Windows 32 bits with size_t arguments !
- Fixed some Pointer endianness bugs

BridJ 0.2 (r1330, 20101011):

- Renamed package com.bridj to org.bridj
- Vastly improved JNAerator support : now decent and complete :-)
- Enhanced C support
	- Faster structs that rely more on JNAerator
	- Optimized structs performance (added comparison tests with Javolution & JNA)
- Enhanced C++ support :
	- Automatic call of C++ destructors
	- Better GCC demangling (contributed by Remi Emonet)
	- Fixed long and size_t signature matching (@CLong and @Ptr annotations)
	- Fixed size computation of (simply) inherited structs and classes
- Enhanced Pointer<T> class :
	- Full JavaDocs
	- Implements List<T>
	- Support for 2D & 3D arrays, with syntax directly equivalent to C :
			float array[100][200];
			float value = array[i][j];
		Is now :
			Pointer<Pointer<Float>> array = pointerToFloats(new float[width][height]);
			// or
			Pointer<Pointer<Float>> array = pointerToFloats(width, height);
			float value = array.get(i).get(j);
	- More consistent read/write methods, added variants for CLong, SizeT, Boolean, CString, WideCString, PascalString, WidePascalString...
	- Renamed getRemainingElements to getValidElements, getRemainingBytes to getValidBytes 
	- Added standard bounds-checked util methods : 
		- Pointer.copyTo (memcpy)
		- moveTo (memmov)
		- clearBytes (memset)
		- findByte (memchr)
	- Fixed multiple-endianness support for floats and doubles
- Added JAWTUtils.getNativePeerHandle(Component)
- Refactored native libraries (a bit smaller)
- Enhanced runtime :
	- Accept .drv as .dll files on Windows
	- Support for name aliasing (@Name, in addition to the @Symbol annotation that bypasses demangling)
	- Now compiling native libraries with full optimizations
	- Fixed assembler optimizations on Win32, added experimental optimizations for Linux64
	- Can now control assembler optimizations : BridJ.setDirectModeEnabled(boolean)
- Built for Win32/64, MacOS X (Universal: x86, x64, ppc), Ubuntu Linux (x86, x64)

BridJ 0.1

- Basic support for C++ with annotations- and demangling-based dynamic signature matching :
	- Normal and virtual methods
	- No class fields
	- No templates
	- No destructors
	- No non-trivial constructors)
- Built for Win32/64, MacOS X (Universal: x86, x64, ppc), Linux32
