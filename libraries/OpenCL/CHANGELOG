Current development version (1.0-SNAPSHOT)

- Now using a nice configuration dialog when launching ParticlesDemo : has
optional OpenCL settings with "Fastest", "Normal" and "Safest" presets +
detailed platform and device choice (with optional OpenGL sharing choice).
- Removed deprecated method JavaCL.createContext(CLDevice...) in favor of
alternative with optional context properties map as first arg (can be nulled
out).
- Fixed issue #18: CLImage.write calls enqueueImageRead !
- Documented workaround for Linux crashes (issue #20) : http://code.google.com/p/javacl/wiki/TroubleShootingJavaCLOnLinux
- Fixed issue #21: NIOUtils.put() doesn't accept ByteBuffer
- Fixed issue #25: CLEvent.waitFor bug causes segfault
- OpenCL 1.1 support :
	- CLContext.createUserEvent()
	- CLUserEvent.setStatus(int), setCompleted()
	- CLEvent.setCallback(status, callbac), setCompletionCallback(callback)
	- CLBuffer.createSubBuffer(usage, offset, length)
	- CLContext.getDeviceCount()
	- CLDevice.getOpenCLVersion()
	- CLDevice.isHostUnifiedMemory()
	- CLDevice.getNativeVectorWidthXXX() methods
	- CLMem.setDestructorCallback(callback)
	- CLKernel.getPreferredWorkGroupSizeMultiple()
	- CLKernel.enqueueNDRange overload with potentially non-null globalOffsets
	- CLImageFormat.ChannelOrder.Rx, RGx, RGBx
- Faster enums
- Check for cl_amd_fp64 in CLDevice.isDoubleSupported()
- Fixed CLProgram.getBinaries()
- 

Version 1.0-beta-4 (r760, 20100121)

- Changed semantics of offset & length arguments in typed CLxxxBuffer.read / write / map methods : now expressed in elements, not in bytes (e.g. 4 bytes per element for CLIntBuffer)
- Added OpenGL interoperability methods to CLContext and CLQueue (can create a CLByteBuffer from an OpenGL buffer object, a CLImage2D/3D from an OpenGL 2D/3D texture or a renderbuffer).
- Added OpenGL-compatible context creation methods to JavaCL & CLPlatform classes
- Added basic reduction support in ReductionUtils (cumulative additions, multiplications, min, max...)
- Created javacl-demos package, with Particles, Hardware Report and Mandelbrot demos...
- Finished migration from NativeLong to NativeSize (changes only the low-level bindings)
- Added profiling methods to CLEvent (+ facility CLDevice.createProfilingQueue())
- Better JavaDoc for low-level bindings (links to Khronos online manual pages)
- Added deferred program allocation : CLProgram.addSource(String), CLProgram.allocate() (called automatically)...
- Added very simple OpenCL backend for UJMP (Universal Java Matrix Package), which does matrix multiplications in OpenCL.
- Created a kernel wrapper autogenerator (Maven plugin based on JNAerator) : translates all constants on the Java side and presents kernels as methods with the correct Java argument types. It assumes OpenCL kernels (*.c, *.cl) are in src/main/opencl
- Added wrappers around clGetKernelWorkGroupInfo
- Fixed respect of endianness of devices that have different endianness than platform
- Fixed issue #10: "getMaxWorkItemSizes() fails on win7 64 GTX260"

Version 1.0-beta-3 (r , 20091030)

- Fixed Issue #8 : NativeLong's can not represent size_t on windows x64 system (all user code that uses the low-level bindings needs to be updated : NativeLong -&gt; NativeSize)
- Added CLContext/CLDevice.isDoubleSupported, isHalfSupported, isByteAddressableStoreSupported
- Added If function to ScalaCL (operates on statements or on expressions)
- Added CLAbstractEntity.release()
- Fixed Issue #4  : CLContext.createContext(CLDevice... devices) created context on only one device
- Regenerated the low level bindings with latest JNAerator : now using NativeSize class instead of NativeLong for size_t (fixes Issue #8)
- Fixed Issue #5  : fixed formatting of CLPlatform.toString()
- Fixed Issue #6  : use max X workgroup dimension for better benchmark speed
- Fixed Issue #7  : CLMem class bug in Usage.WriteOnly and Usage.ReadWrite
- Fixed Issue #11 : call clRetainMemObject when sharing a cl_mem between CLBuffer instances.
- Choose 'best' device in benchmark test

Version 1.0-beta-2

- JAR is now self-sufficient (includes JNA + JNAerator's runtime classes)
- Added CLKernel.setLocalArg(argIndex, localArgByteLength)
- Allow localWorkSizes to be null in enqueueNDRange
- Added support for barriers and markers in CLQueue
- Fixed issue #2 : enqueueNDRange does not work for nDim > 1
- Added CLDevice.getMaxWorkItemSizes()
- CLDevice.toString() now only prints the name
- Moved method createContext from CLContext to CLPlatform
- Added all the CL_DEVICE_PREFERRED_VECTOR_WIDTH_XXX infos to CLDevice as getPreferredVectorWithXXX()
- Changed return type of getExtensions() method of both CLPlatform and CLDevice from String to String[]
- Added com.nativelibs4java.opencl.HardwareReport (with main method) : outputs html report with devices stats
- Rationalized naming of all enums : CL_ENTITY_ATTRIBUTE_SOME_VALUE = CLEntity.Attribute.SomeValue (enum item SomeValue in enum Attribute in class CLEntity)
- Added full support of images :
	- CLContext.getSupportedImageFormats + CLImageFormat and associated enums
	- CLImage2D, CLImage3D and corresponding creation methods in CLContext + all image info getters
- CLMem is now an abstract base class 
	- CLBuffer with typed subclasses (CLByteBuffer, CLIntBuffer..)
	- To create a CLBuffer : context.createIntBuffer(Input, size)
	- Added CLBuffer.copyTo (clEnqueueCopyBuffer)
	- Each typed CLBuffer subclass has map, mapLater, read methods that return typed NIO buffers
- Added full typing of OpenCL Exceptions (now possible to selectively catch a CLException.OutOfHostMemory, for instance)
- Added hashCode and equals method to most classes
- Added ability to create out of order queues and change queue properties after creation

Version 1.0-beta-1

- New CLPlatform class (~ OpenCL implementation) which now hosts the list*Devices(...) methods 
- Entry point of library is now OpenCL4Java.listPlatforms() 
- New CLEvent class, returned by all enqueue* methods (with methods waitFor, invokeUponCompletion...) 
- Better separation between blocking and non blocking calls 
- New CLSampler class supported as argument of CLKernel 
- Many info getters with typesafe enums / enum sets in classes CLDevice, CLPlatform, CLKernel... 
- Much more complete JavaDoc : http://nativelibs4java.sourceforge.net/sites/OpenCL4Java/apidocs/ 
- Example & benchmark classes became JUnit tests and moved here : http://code.google.com/p/nativelibs4java/source/browse/#svn/trunk/lib... 

While this release is rather OpenCL4Java-focused, ScalaCL also got its bunch of enhancements : 
- Added scalar variables IntVar, FloatVar, ShortVar... 
- 'local' keyword can be added to variables so they're local to the programs : val x = FloatVar local 
- Added many OpenCL math functions 
- Added methods ArrayVar.write(Range), ArrayVar.write(Seq) 
- Various bugfixes
