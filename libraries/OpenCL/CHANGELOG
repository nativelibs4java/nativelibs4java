Current development version (1.0-SNAPSHOT)

- Fixed handling of image2d_t and image3d_t in Maven plugin (contrib. from Remi Emonet, request #308 and issue #307)
- Fixed OpenGL interop on Windows (issue #312)
- Added CLEvent.FIRE_AND_FORGET to avoid returning events from all the methods that accept a vararg eventsToWaitFor.
- Optimized low-level bindings on OpenCL 1.1+ platforms, with dynamic runtime switch (removed synchronized keyword from all native calls)
- Optimized performance of many calls (CLKernel.setArgs/enqueueNDRange, CLBuffer.read/write...)

Version 1.0.0-RC2 (20120415, commit 6bc061dfce06b941086a29f696195e82fbaffbdc)

- Added support for sub-images reading/writing from/to CLImage2D (slower than with full images)
- Fixed endianness issues with CLBuffer (issue #80)
- Fixed migration of cached binaries to newer versions of OS (e.g. upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion) (issue #81)
- Fixed handling compiler options containing spaces (issue #274)
- Fixed tutorial artifact pom repositories (issue #279)
- Fixed many Javadoc typos
- Fixed support of Intel's OpenCL Windows runtime (issue #297)

- Deprecated CLContext.getKernelsDefaultByteOrder() and CLDevice.getKernelsDefaultByteOrder()
- Added more informative exceptions when passing null pointers to CLBuffer.writeBytes (issue #257)
- Updated to OpenCL 1.2 headers
- Added -cl-nv-verbose, -cl-nv-maxrregcount, -cl-nv-opt-level + proper log even without error when nv-verbose is set
- Enhanced handling of endianness : warn when creating contexts with devices that have mismatching endianness, throw when creating buffer out of Buffer / Pointer with bad endianness
- Changed signature of CLPlatform.listDevices (now takes a single CLDevice.Type, including All, instead of an EnumSet thereof)
- Moved sources to github  (https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/tree/master/libraries/OpenCL)

Version 1.0.0-RC1 (r2130, 20110621)

- BridJ version now becomes the default : the JNA version is still maintained and available with all Maven artifact ids suffixed with "-jna" (BridJ-based JavaCL's main artifact is now "javacl", while the JNA-based version is "javacl-jna")  
- added simple Fourier-analysis classes (package com.nativelibs4java.opencl.util.fft), with double and float variants, usable with primitive arrays or OpenCL buffers :
	- naive Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) 
	- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for power-of-two arrays / buffers (performs better than Apache Commons on a CPU) 
- added some compiler options to CLProgram :
	- setFastRelaxedMath() (triggers all the others !)
	- setFiniteMathOnly()
	- setUnsafeMathOptimizations()
	- setMadEnable()
	- setNoSignedZero()
- added CLContext.createBuffer(Usage, Buffer)
- added CLBuffer.copyTo(CLQueue, CLMem destination, CLEvent...) and CLBuffer.emptyClone(Usage)
- added NIOUtils.indirectBuffer(size, bufferClass)
- added CLContext.toString
- deprecated CLXXXBuffer in favor of CLBuffer<XXX> (CLIntBuffer becomes CLBuffer<Integer>, etc...)
- changed CLContext.createBuffer(Usage, length, class) to createBuffer(Usage, class, length) to match the JavaCL/BridJ API (and provoke migration issues : people should now use a primitive class rather than an NIO buffer class !!!
- complete rewrite of CLBuffer genericity to unify with the BridJ port : CLBuffer<DoubleBuffer> is now CLBuffer<Double>, and CLBuffer.read/write/map are no longer strongly typed (it is implicitely typed with Buffer subclasses for compatibility with existing code). The BridJ port will be favoured, and its read/write/map methods use typed Pointer<T>.
- complete rewrite of UJMP Matrix implementation, using principles borrowed from ScalaCL
- fixed issue #66 (create temp files in ~/.javacl subdirectories instead of /tmp)
- fixed OpenGL sharing on MacOS X
- fixed CLProgram.getBinaries() in some cases
- fixed CLBuffer.read on indirect buffers
- fixed NPE that happens with null varargs CLEvent[] array
- fixed length = 1 case in reduction utility
- fixed ATI detection ("ATI Stream" now replaced by "AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing", cf. Csaba's comment in issue #39)
- fixed issue #55 : applied Kazo Csaba's patch to fix the bounds of CLBuffer.map's returned buffer
- fixed inheritance of CLBuildException (now derives from CLException)

Version 1.0-beta-6 (r1637, 20100204)

- Fixed support of ATI Stream 2.3 (CPU)
- New interactive image kernel demo : lets you edit and test image kernels in a snap (bundled with a few samples) 
- Experimental BridJ port with same functionality as JNA-powered version, but smaller and faster (JAR weighs 750 kB instead of 1.8 MB, overhead per-function call about 10x smaller)
- Added automatic and transparent program binaries caching :
	- Disabled by default on ATI Stream.
	- Can force on/off with :
		- property -Djavacl.cacheBinaries=true/false
		- environment variable JAVACL_CACHE_BINARIES=1/0
		- methods CLContext.setCacheBinaries and CLProgram.setCached
- JavaCL.createBestContext now takes an ordered list of CLPlatform.DeviceFeature enums that help prioritize the features considered as "best" (list can be empty or contain any of CPU, GPU, DoubleSupport, MaxComputeUnits, NativeEndianness, ImageSupport, MostImageFormats...). These features are preferences, not requirements : with createBestContext(GPU, MaxComputeUnits) you might end up getting a CPU-based context if there's no GPU available, but you'll have the most powerful GPU (in terms of compute units) if there are two of them.
- Kernels can now include files that are in the classpath (+ added CLProgram.addInclude that accepts directories and base URLs)
- Added LibCL : growing collection of OpenCL functions that can be included from any JavaCL kernel
- CLKernel.enqueueNDRange has a new overload without localWorkSizes argument (it's then adjusted to a good value by the OpenCL implementation).
- ScalaCLv2 was rewritten to fit nicely into Scala's collections framework.
- Added CLContext.createProgram(Map<CLDevice, byte[]>) to create from saved binaries (contribution from Kazo Csaba, issue #30)
- Added CLProgram.addBuildOption(String)
- Fixed CLBuffer.copyTo
- Demos now use the latest jogamp JOGL binaries (see the updated build instructions : http://code.google.com/p/javacl/wiki/Build)

- Now using a nice configuration dialog when launching ParticlesDemo : has
optional OpenCL settings with "Fastest", "Normal" and "Safest" presets +
detailed platform and device choice (with optional OpenGL sharing choice).
- Added optional context properties map argument to JavaCL.createContext (can be nulled
out)
- Fixed issue #18: CLImage.write calls enqueueImageRead !

Version 1.0-beta-4 (r760, 20100121)

- Changed semantics of offset & length arguments in typed CLxxxBuffer.read / write / map methods : now expressed in elements, not in bytes (e.g. 4 bytes per element for CLIntBuffer)
- Added OpenGL interoperability methods to CLContext and CLQueue (can create a CLByteBuffer from an OpenGL buffer object, a CLImage2D/3D from an OpenGL 2D/3D texture or a renderbuffer).
- Added OpenGL-compatible context creation methods to JavaCL & CLPlatform classes
- Added basic reduction support in ReductionUtils (cumulative additions, multiplications, min, max...)
- Created javacl-demos package, with Particles, Hardware Report and Mandelbrot demos...
- Finished migration from NativeLong to NativeSize (changes only the low-level bindings)
- Added profiling methods to CLEvent (+ facility CLDevice.createProfilingQueue())
- Better JavaDoc for low-level bindings (links to Khronos online manual pages)
- Added deferred program allocation : CLProgram.addSource(String), CLProgram.allocate() (called automatically)...
- Added very simple OpenCL backend for UJMP (Universal Java Matrix Package), which does matrix multiplications in OpenCL.
- Created a kernel wrapper autogenerator (Maven plugin based on JNAerator) : translates all constants on the Java side and presents kernels as methods with the correct Java argument types. It assumes OpenCL kernels (*.c, *.cl) are in src/main/opencl
- Added wrappers around clGetKernelWorkGroupInfo
- Fixed respect of endianness of devices that have different endianness than platform
- Fixed issue #10: "getMaxWorkItemSizes() fails on win7 64 GTX260"

Version 1.0-beta-3 (r , 20091030)

- Fixed Issue #8 : NativeLong's can not represent size_t on windows x64 system (all user code that uses the low-level bindings needs to be updated : NativeLong -&gt; NativeSize)
- Added CLContext/CLDevice.isDoubleSupported, isHalfSupported, isByteAddressableStoreSupported
- Added If function to ScalaCL (operates on statements or on expressions)
- Added CLAbstractEntity.release()

- Fixed Issue #6  : use max X workgroup dimension for better benchmark speed
- Fixed Issue #7  : CLMem class bug in Usage.WriteOnly and Usage.ReadWrite
- Fixed Issue #11 : call clRetainMemObject when sharing a cl_mem between CLBuffer instances.
- Choose 'best' device in benchmark test

- Added full support of images :
	- CLContext.getSupportedImageFormats + CLImageFormat and associated enums
	- CLImage2D, CLImage3D and corresponding creation methods in CLContext + all image info getters
