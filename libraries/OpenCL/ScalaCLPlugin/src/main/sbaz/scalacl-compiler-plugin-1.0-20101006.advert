Author: Olivier Chafik &lt;olivier.chafik@gmail.com&gt;

Current general optimizations include :
- Rewrite of int range foreach loops into faster while loops
- Rewrite of Array[T].foreach into while loops (for T being primitive or AnyRef)
- Rewrite of Array[T].map into while loops
- Rewrite of Array[T].foldLeft / foldRight into while loops
- Rewrite of Array[T].reduceLeft / reduceRight into while loops
- Rewrite of Array[T].scanLeft / scanRight into while loops

Current ScalaCL / OpenCL-specific optimizations include :
- Transforming Scala functions given to CLCol[T].map, foreach and filter into OpenCL kernels (supports only limited inline lambdas)

More optimizations are scheduled, such as :
- Autovectorization of ScalaCL loops
- Auto-ScalaCL-ization of general code (upon explicit demand via a compiler option, as this introduces runtime dependency on ScalaCL)
- Support for external references in ScalaCL functions, including external calls (when target is invariant and can be converted to OpenCL)
